== Description ==
StackOverflow.com Reputation WordPress Plugin is a sidebar widget which shows your user information from StackOverflow.com. You must add the widget from your WordPress Widgets, input your username and user id from StackOverflow.com and it will display a link to your profile, your reputation, and the quantity of badges you have earned. The idea of getting the user info from StackOverflow.com's user search via POST was thanks to http://pietschsoft.com/post/2008/10/Place-a-StackOverflow-badge-on-your-website.aspx.

==Installation==

* Upload plugin directory into you wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Login to your WordPress Admin menu, go to Plugins, and activate it.
* Go to (Appearence) Widgets Options, add StackOverflow Widget, and input your information.

==Other notes==

Hope there's an API for StackOverflow soon...
Disclaimer: This plugin is not supported by StackOverflow.com, I have no relation with StackOverflow.com other than being a user.
